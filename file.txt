imad swap project is a verysimple and a highly straigh
tforward algorithm project
odata must be sorted.You have at your disposal a set of integer
values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructionsto manipulate both stacks
Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates a
nd displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap l
anguage instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.
Easy?
Weâ€™ll see...
